## Create a Single Blueprint VM

With **Projects** created in Calm, Sally is now ready to create application
blueprint to solve the issues. However, before she embarks on it she wants to 
test out Calm's IaaS features by creating and testing it on a single blueprint VM.

# Create a SingleBP in Calm

1. Go to Prism Central -> Services -> Calm.

2. Click on ![](images/bp_icon.png) button then select **Single VM Blueprint**.

3. Under Blueprint Settings, fill up the following:

   - Name: <CentOS7_your initials>
   - Project: <DMC3-POCxx_your_initials>
   - Environment: <DMC3-POCxx_your_initials>

   Click **VM details** to proceed to the next step.

4. Name your blueprint with your initials e.g - <your_initials_BP>. In addition, as we are 
   creating a CentOS machine,please ensure the displayed operating system shows "Linux". To proceed,
   click **VM configuration**.

:::note
You will also notice that there is a **Clone from environment**
button beside **Preset VM Config** where you can inherit all vm settings from what
you have define in your environment. In this exercise we will learn how to make further
customization to it.

5. In **VM Configuration** window, fill in the details of the machine you wish to deploy:

      - vCPU:   4
      - Cores per vCPU:   2
      - Memory:   8
      - Under guest customization, please tick the checkbox beside **Guest Customization**

        users:
         - name: @@{cred_os.username}@@
           groups: sudo
           shell: /bin/bash
           sudo: ['ALL=(ALL) NOPASSWD:ALL']
           ssh-authorized-keys:
             - @@{cred_os.public_key}@@
         ```
      - Disks: CentOS7.qcow2
      - NICs:  Primary
