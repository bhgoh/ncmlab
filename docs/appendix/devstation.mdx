A best practice when administrating and managing your production workload system in the real-world
is through a jump-box type like machine in which can access directly and as a gateway towards your
production machines. We will liken this jump-box like a developer workstation-DevStation where management
tools and it dependencies can all be installed into a single location to faciliate those connections.
It can also be rather handy as a machine where you can write your scripts to be deployed against them.

This is entirely an optional exercise as without this, you can still complete all the labs given.

However, if a DevStation is for you, please continute with the rest of this section to build your own
dream DevStation!

        # Create a new user
        users:
          - default
          - name: nutanix
            groups: wheel, users
            ssh_authorized_keys:
         # Paste the generated public key here
         - ssh-rsa AAAAB3NzaC1....
         # You can also use the salter 1N or 6N format using OPENSSL (openssl passwd -1 -salt SaltSalt "yourplaintextpassword")
         # Paste the generated password here
         passwd: $1$SaltSalt$aOsqVFP2QULyFo5JYkOYB/
         shell: /bin/bash
         lock-passwd: false
         ssh_pwauth: True                 

         # Enable password authentication for root
         ssh_pwauth: True

         # Run additional commands
         runcmd:
         - 'sleep 10' # sleeping for the network to be UP
         - 'echo "nutanix ALL=(ALL) NOPASSWD: ALL" >> /etc/sudoers'

         # Run package upgrade
         package_upgrade: true

         # Install the following packages - add extra that you would need

10. Click on **Next**.

11. Click **Create VM** at the bottom.

12. Go back to **Prism Central > Menu > Compute and Storage > VMs**.

13. Select your _initials_Linux-ToolsVM.

14. Under **Actions** drop-down menu, choose **Power On**.

:::note
It may take up to 10 minutes for the VM to be ready.

You can watch the console of the VM from Prism Central to make sure all 
the clouinit script has finished running.

15. Login to the VM via SSH or Console session, using the following command:

    ```
    ssh -i <your_private_key> -l nutanix <IP of LinuxToolsVM>
