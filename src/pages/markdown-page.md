## Getting Started

Welcome to Nutanix Cloud Manager (NCM) workshop.

This workshop accompanies an instructor-led session that introduces NCM on Nutanix HCI on Acropolis Hypervisors (AHV). By completing all the labs, you will gain knowledge on creating single or multiple VM blueprints and link day 2 actions with them through runbooks or playbooks. You will gain insights into Nutanix v3APIs and take advantage of it to automate mundane daily tasks.
